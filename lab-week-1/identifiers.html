                <h3>Personal Identification Number (PIN)</h3>
            A personal identification number (PIN), or sometimes redundantly a PIN number, is a numeric or alpha-numeric password used in the process of authenticating a user accessing a system.
            Example: 123456, 1111, abcxyz123, ...

                <h3>National identification number</h3>
            A national identification number, national identity number, or national insurance number is used by the governments of many countries as a means of tracking their citizens, permanent residents, and temporary residents for the purposes of work, taxation, government benefits, health care, and other governmentally-related functions. 
            The number appears on identity documents issued by several countries.
            The ways in which such a system is implemented vary among countries, but in most cases citizens are issued an identification number upon reaching legal age, or when they are born. 
            Non-citizens may be issued such numbers when they enter the country, or when granted a temporary or permanent residence permit.
            Example: 013522345, 001049019593, ...

                <h3>Tax identification number (TIN)</h3>
            A tax or taxpayer identification number, also known as a TIN for short, is a number issued to individuals and organizations to track tax obligations and payments they make to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 
            It is issued by the federal government.
            A TIN can be assigned by the Social Security Administration for individuals, or by the IRS for businesses and other organizations.
            Example: 12-3456789, ...
            <li>
                <h3>Student Number</h3>
             Each student is provided with a student card or a student certificate including a corresponding student ID number.
             Example: 20168888, 20132923, ...
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Serial number</h3>
            A serial number is a unique identifier assigned incrementally or sequentially to an item, to uniquely identify it.
